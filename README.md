## Statistical analysis strategy for the generation of synthetic data from open data

The repository describes an agile strategy in statistical analysis to generate synthetic data with scientific and commercial uses, using two open data sources. The result is an algorithm that allows characterizing the socioeconomic level and the income and expenditure profiles of households at a level (block level) for the entire country, which can be replicated for various countries with equivalent open data layers.

Sandbox scenario was implemented, connected to a data lake, in which with the IDE Jupyter notebooks and python packages, Data Engineering created codes for the extraction, loading, transformation of open data that serve as an input for training with data science techniques, according to best practices

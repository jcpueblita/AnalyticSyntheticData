## Generating Synthetic Data from Open Data: An Agile Strategy in Statistical Analysis

The repository describes an agile strategy in statistical analysis to generate synthetic data with scientific and commercial uses, using two open data sources. The result is an algorithm that allows characterizing the socioeconomic level and the income and expenditure profiles of households at a level (block level) for the entire country, which can be replicated for various countries with equivalent open data layers.

The tools are based on open source through the IDE Jupyter notebook, an interactive web development environment with support for different languages, in which Python stands out. It allows combining code execution with documentation and visualizations in a single file, facilitating prototyping and dissemination of results. The notebook contains data engineering codes with Python programming language and packages for the extraction, loading and transformation (ELT) of the open data, which serve as input to obtain the synthetic data in accordance with best practices

Sandbox scenario was implemented, connected to a data lake, in which with the IDE Jupyter notebooks and python packages, Data Engineering created codes for the extraction, loading, transformation of open data that serve as an input for training with data science techniques, according to best practices
